# TOKEN AND POOL MONITOR
This is a vanilla token and pool tracker. It tracks newly minted tokens on Pumpfun and newly created pools on Raydium. It's super basic and ready to use.

## Getting Started
Make sure to enable the correct action from the monitor in the  `./src/settings` file. Note that you can only monitor one action at a time, as running multiple actions simultaneously could interfere with your RPC and cause rate limiting.

```shell
#This will install the packages and run the CLI 
cargo run
```
